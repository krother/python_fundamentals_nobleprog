Getting Started
===============

**Today we will work on a Kingdom Simulator game.**

|image0|

Exercise 1
----------

Here is an **incomplete** Python program:

.. literalinclude:: sim_kingdom.py

Fill in the following lines in the gaps marked by `...`:

.. code:: python3

   quarries += 1
     
   stone = 0

   selected == '3' and wood >= 100 and stone >= 100 and mana >= 100

   print(f"[{counter}] {name}")

   stone += quarries


----

Exercise 2
----------

Execute the program. Play a few rounds and check whether the program works.

----

Exercise 3
----------

The game is not complete yet.

Add the option to build a **mage tower**. It costs 10 wood and 15 stone
and produces 1 mana per turn.

----

Exercise 4
----------

There is a small bug in the program. You might notice it when you solve
the game.

What needs to be done to fix it?

----

Reflection
----------

What language elements or syntax rules of Python have you seen so far?

Collect them in the `Spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q9s-KTkw8_HvkJZO_hcMXw01m9w9HVGGBaAU8oZ4gsM/edit?usp=sharing>`__
