Installing Python
=================

To use Python, you need the **Python Interpreter** and a **Code Editor**.
I recommend the following:

-  `Python 3.10+ <https://www.python.org>`__
-  `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__

There are plenty of other installation options
(e.g.Â the Anaconda distribution and VSCode), but in my opinion this is the best one.

Installing Libraries
--------------------

Open a terminal. On MacOS and Linux your normal terminal should be fine.
On Windows, the command line within PyCharm is probably the safest way
to get it working fast. Install a few libraries from the command line
with:

::

   pip install pytest
   pip install numpy
   pip install pandas
   pip install seaborn jupyter

There are more Python libraries you might try, but installing them is
not difficult (and a good opportunity to discuss dependency management).
