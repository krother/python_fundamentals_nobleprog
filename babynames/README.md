Throughout the day, we will write code to evaluate **baby name counts** from the US.
We will use two sets of data:

* [bigbang_names.csv](bigbang_names.csv) : a small file with the names from Big Bang Theory for one year
* [national data](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) - files for all years (use the 7 MB download)
