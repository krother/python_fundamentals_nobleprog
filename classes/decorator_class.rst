Decorator Classes
=================

Decorator Classes are a structure to write more sophisticated decorators
that have an internal state. They allow you to pass arguments into the
decorator as well.

Here is a code example that counts how many errors have been produced.

.. code:: python3

   class FailureCounter:

       def __init__(self, message):
           self.message = message
           self.function = None
           self.failcount = 0

       def __call__(self, func):
           self.function = func
           return self.safe_call

       def safe_call(self, *args):
           try:
               self.function(*args)
           except IOError:
               self.failcount += 1
               print(self.message)
               print(f'An I/O error was caught in {self.function.__name__}')
               print(f"with the file name '{args[0]}'")
               print(f'this is failure #{self.failcount}\n')


   @FailureCounter('--- FILE ERROR ---')
   def risky_fileopen(filename):
       open(filename)

   risky_fileopen('not_existing_file')
   risky_fileopen('doesnotexist_either')


.. note::
    
    -  the constructor ``__init__()`` receives the arguments given in the line starting with ``@``
    -  the ``__call__()`` method should return the decorator function
    -  the ``safe_call()`` method gets called in the end (you can give it a different name)
