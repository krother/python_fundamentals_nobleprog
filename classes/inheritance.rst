Inheritance
===========

Classes can extend other classes. A **subclass** will have all the
attributes and methods of a **superclass**. You can say the subclass
inherits from the superclass.

A subclass can define new methods and attributes. It can also replace
methods of the superclass.

The most important design principle when using inheritance is **Liskovs
Substitution Principle**. It says that you should be able to use a
subclass whereever the superclass is used.

Here you find an example using the ``Account`` class defined earlier.

.. code:: python3
    
   class SavingsAccount(Account):

       def __init__(self, owner, start_balance=0, interest_rate=1.0):
           super().__init__(owner, start_balance)
           self.interest_rate = interest_rate

       def add_interest(self):
           self.balance *= self.interest_rate

       def withdraw(self, amount):  # replaces Account.withdraw
           print('**extra identification approved**')
           super().withdraw(amount)

The ``super()`` function returns an instance of the superclass, so that
you can call the inherited methods, even if you are replacing them.

Using the subclass is very similar to using the superclass:

.. code:: python3
    
   b = SavingsAccount('Betty', 100, interest_rate=1.03)
   print(b)

   b.deposit(100)  # calls Account.deposit()
   print(b)        # calls Account.__repr__()

   b.add_interest()  # calls SavingsAccount.add_interest()
   print(b)

Caveats
-------

Once you get the hang of object-oriented programming, inheritance is not
that difficult. At some point, it is very tempting to define lots of
subclasses, and class hierarchies with multiple levels. Most of the
time, having one level of inheritance is enough. Many times you do not
need inheritance at all, and you are better off using **object
composition**.

Python allows to use **multiple inheritance** (i.e.Â a subclass with more than one superclass).
Avoid writing your own multiple inheritance hierarchy.
Python is not Java where you define interfaces for everything.
A Python program has to become very large before multiple inheritance pays off.
