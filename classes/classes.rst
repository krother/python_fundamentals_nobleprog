Classes
=======

What are classes?
-----------------

Classes are a tool to manage complexity in a program. They group two
things in a single structural unit: **attributes (data)** and **methods
(behavior)**.
You can use a class to structure both data and behavior, so that the rest of your program becomes less complex.
In this chapter, you find an example how to use a class to structure your code.

--------------

Defining a class
----------------

To define a class, you need to define three things:

-  give the class a name (in ``SnakeCase``)
-  define attributes (variables that belong to the class)
-  define methods (functions that belong to the class)

In the code below, a class for a bank account is defined:

.. code:: python3

   class Account:
       """
       Account of a bank client.
       """
       def __init__(self, owner, start_balance=0):
           self.name = owner
           self.balance = start_balance

       def deposit(self, amt):
           self.balance += amt

       def withdraw(self, amt):
           self.balance -= amt

The class ``Account`` contains two attributes (``name`` and ``balance``)
and two methods (``deposit`` and ``withdraw``).

Note that you need to add the word ``self`` every time you refer to an
attribute. You also must use ``self`` as the first parameter in every
method of a class.

--------------

Creating Objects
----------------

To use a class, you need to create an object from it first. Objects are
*“live versions”* of a class, the class being an idealized abstration
(in the sense of `Platos Theory of Forms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms>`__). 
If you think of **Human** as a class, **Ada Lovelace** and **Mahatma Gandi** would be
objects.

You can create multiple objects from a class, and each objects has its
own, independent attributes (e.g. if **Human** has an attribute **age**,
the age of **Ada** and **Mahatma** might be different).

Syntactically, you can think of a class as a function that returns
objects. (This is a gross oversimplification to what textbooks on
classes say, but in Python it is more or less what happens).

To create ``Account`` objects, you need to call the class. Creating an
object will automatically call the constructor ``__init__(self)`` with
the parameters supplied.

.. code:: python3

   a = Account('Ada Lovelace', 1234)
   m = Account('Mahatma Gandhi', 10)

Then you can access the attributes like any variable using the dot
(``.``) syntax:

.. code:: python3

   print(a.name)
   print(m.balance)

And you can call methods in a similar way:

.. code:: python3

   a.deposit(100)
   a.withdraw(10)
   print(a.balance)

Note that these methods modify the state of *Adas* account object, but
not *Mahatmas*.

--------------

Making classes printable
------------------------

One disadvantage of classes is that when you print an object, you will
see something like this:

::

   <__main__.Account at 0x7f64519d8438>

A good workaround is to add a special method, ``__repr__(self)`` to the
class that returns a string. This method will be called every time a
string representation is needed: when printing and object, when an
object appears inside a list or in error messages.

Typically, you would build a short string in ``__repr__(self)`` that
describes the object:

.. code:: python3

   def __repr__(self):
       return f"<Account of '{self.name}' with {self.balance} galactic credits>"

With this method defined, the instruction

.. code:: python3

   print(a)

would result in the output

::

   <Account of 'Ada Lovelace' with 1324 galactic credits>"

It is a good idea to implement ``__repr__(self)`` as the first method in
a new class.

--------------

Caveats
-------

In other programming languages classes are often advertised for
*“modeling real-world objects or logical entities”*. This is partially
true in Python. Note that Python offers a lot of alternatives to using
classes, e.g. dictionaries, named tuples or DataFrames may often serve
the same purpose equally well.

Another motivation for using classes you find in textbooks is
**encapsulation**, isolating parts of your program from the rest.
Encapsulation does not exist in Python (e.g. you cannot declare parts of
a class as ``private`` in a way that cannot be circumvented). If you
depend on your code being strictly isolated from other parts (e.g. in a
security-critical application or when organizing a very large program),
**consider other programming languages than Python.**

--------------

Dirty Tricks
------------

On the other hand, Python allows using classes in multiple creative
ways. I call them **dirty tricks**. Most of them have their uses in
larger programming libraries. But if you are writing a smaller program,
they probably do more harm than good.

Especially if you are still learning about classes, consider yourself
warned of the following tricks:

-  Multiple Inheritance
-  Operator Overloading
-  Metaclasses
-  Monkey Patching

These dirty tricks are likely to mess up your program. Do not use any of
them unless you really know what you are doing!
