# Getting Started

**Today we will work on a Kingdom Simulator game.**

### Exercise 1

Open the file [sim_kingdom.py](sim_kingdom.py).

Fill in the correct code sniplets into the gaps marked by `...`:

   quarries += 1
      
   stone = 0

   selected == '3' and wood >= 100 and stone >= 100 and mana >= 100

   print(f"[{counter}] {name}")

   stone += quarries

----

### Exercise 2

Execute the program. Enter a few commands and check whether it works.

----

### Exercise 3

The game is not complete yet.

Add the option to build a **mage tower**.
It costs 10 wood and 15 stone and produces 1 mana per turn.

----

### Exercise 4

There is a subtle bug in the program.
You might notice it when you solve the game.

What needs to be done to fix it?

----

### Reflection

What language elements or syntax rules of Python have you seen so far?

Collect them in the [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q9s-KTkw8_HvkJZO_hcMXw01m9w9HVGGBaAU8oZ4gsM/edit?usp=sharing)
