# Prerequisites

This course aims to cover the fundamentals of Python for people with little programming experience, those who made their first steps in Python already and for those with experience in a different language.

## Installing Python

You need the following programs:

* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org)
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

If you have a different editor (e.g. the Anaconda distribution or VSCode), this is also fine but it is less likely that I can help you.

## Installing Libraries

Open a terminal. On MacOS and Linux your normal terminal should be fine.
On Windows, the command line within PyCharm is probably the safest way to get it working fast.
Install a few libraries from the command line with:

    pip install pytest numpy pandas seaborn jupyter

There are more Python libraries you might try, but installing them is not difficult or long (and a good opportunity to discuss dependency management).
