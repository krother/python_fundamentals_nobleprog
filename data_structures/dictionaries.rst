Dictionaries
============

Dictionaries are unordered, associative arrays. They consist of
key/value pairs. They are very versatile data structures, but more
difficult to use than lists if you are new to Python. As the name
implies, dictionaries are good for looking up things, or **searching**
in general.

----

Creating dictionaries
---------------------

Python dictionaries are defined with winged brackets. On the left side
of each entry is the **key**, on the right side the **value**:

.. code:: python3

   ratios = {
       'Alice': 0.75,
       'Bob': 0.55,
       'Charlie': 0.80
       }

----

Accessing elements in dictionaries
----------------------------------

By using square brackets and a key, you can retrieve the values from a
dictionary. At least if the key is present:

.. code:: python3

   ratios['Alice']    # 0.75
   ratios['Ewing']    # KeyError!

----

Retrieving values in a fail-safe way:
-------------------------------------

With the ``get()`` method you can assign an alternative value if the key
was not found.

.. code:: python3

   ratios.get('Alice')
   ratios.get('Ewing', 'sorry not found')

----

Changing values in a dictionary
-------------------------------

The contents of a dictionary can be modified.
For instance if you start with an empty dictionary, you can add values one key/value pair at a time:

.. code:: python3

   persons = {}
   persons['Emily'] = 1977

----

Setting values only if they dont exist yet:
-------------------------------------------

.. code:: python3

   persons.setdefault('Alice', 1980)
   persons.setdefault('Emily', 1898)
   # for 'Emily', nothing happens

----

Getting all keys or values:
---------------------------

.. code:: python3

   ratios.keys()
   ratios.values()
   ratios.items()

----

Checking whether a key exists
-----------------------------

The ``in`` operators checks whether a key exists in the dictionary.

.. code:: python3

   if 'Bob' in ratios:
       print('found it')

Note that you can use ``in`` for the same with a list as well. The
dictionary is **much faster**!

----

Loops over a dictionary
-----------------------

You can access the keys of a dictionary in a ``for`` loop.

.. code:: python3

   for name in ratios:
       print(name)

The order is stable in all current versions of Python.

.. code:: python3

   for name in sorted(ratios):
       print(name)    

----

.. question:: What data can I use as keys?

   Keys of dictionaries can be any **immutable** data types:

   -  integers
   -  floats
   -  strings
   -  tuples
   -  booleans

   You may mix keys of different type in one dictionary. However,
   **mutable** data types such as lists and other dictionaries are not allowed as keys.

   The concept behind this phenomenon is that dictionaries use a **hash function** to sort the keys internally. The hash function is what allows
   to look up values very quickly.
