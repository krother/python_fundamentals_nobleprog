Conditional statements with ``if``
==================================

The ``if`` statement is used to implement decisions and branching in a
program. One or more instructions are only executed if a condition
matches:

.. code:: python3

   if name == 'Emily':
       studies = 'Physics'

There must be an ``if`` block, zero or more ``elif``\ â€™s and an optional
``else`` block:

.. code:: python3

   if name == 'Emily':
       studies = 'Physics'
   elif name == 'Maria':
       studies = 'Computer Science'
   elif name == 'Sarah':
       studies = 'Archaeology'
   else:
       studies = '-- not registered yet --'

----

Code blocks
-----------

After an ``if`` statement, all indented commands are treated as a code
block, and are executed in the context of the condition.

The next unindented command is executed in any case.

----

Comparison operators
--------------------

An ``if`` expression may contain comparison operators like:

.. code:: python3

   a == b
   a != b
   a < b
   a > b
   a <= b
   a >= b

On lists and strings you can also use:

.. code:: python3

   a in b

Multiple expressions can be combined with boolean logic (``and``,
``or``, ``not``):

.. code:: python3

   a or b
   a and b
   not a
   (a or b) and not (c or d)

----

Boolean value of variables
--------------------------

Each variable can be interpreted as a boolean (``True``/``False``)
value. All values are treated as ``True``, except for:

.. code:: python3

   False
   0
   []
   ''
   {}
   set()
   None
