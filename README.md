## How to find out whether a function / method exists?

* methods of strings / lists / dicts : learn these
* builtin functions : learn the 24 builtin functions
* to learn them: type in commands from [Cheat Sheets](cheat_sheets/)
* in modules from the standard library (pre-installed): use the context help in your IDE
* use [devdocs.io](devdocs.io/)

## How to find out which library to use for a given purpose?

start with a list of frequently used packages

* [Academis package examples](https://www.academis.eu/python_packages) - one example for 30+ libraries
* [fullstackpython.com](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) (web development)
* [Awesome Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) - huge but curated list
* [PyAutoGUI: GUI Testing](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui) - Haven't tried it but author is well known

## Where to find code examples?

* [Academis Python reference](https://www.academis.eu/python_reference) - beginners vocabulary
* [Chris Albon](https://chrisalbon.com/) - tons of short data science examples
* [pandas user guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - data analysis
* [Scipy-Lectures](https://scipy-lectures.org/) - plotting and numpy
* [Graphics with Numpy](https://www.academis.eu/numpy_graphics) - easy numpy examples
